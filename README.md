# GroupProject1
 
This is for DIG4715C Group Project 1: a prototype game based on PAC-MAN. This is in a very, VERY unfinished state. All of the art assets are in the game files, but the C# scripts are very much non-functional.

Screenshots shown are art assets & the intended look of the game. They do not represent the gameplay.

"THE END" screen uses art from <a href="<a href=" https:="" www.freepik.com="" free-photos-vectors="" tree"="">Tree" class="redactor-linkify-object">https://www.freepik.com/free-photos-vectors/tree">Tree</a> vector created by brgfx - www.freepik.com.
